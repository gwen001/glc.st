After many years of web development, I finally decided to follow my dream: perform in the security industry.
In 2015, after 3 months of hard work, I successfully passed the famous exam Penetration
Testing with Kali Linux exam aka OSCP.

Since, security is my daily.  
I perform security audits and I am an active member of the community, I created many tools to automate the basics of recon.

In order to promote the Bug Bounty industry, I also help companies in this adventure.
Whether for a first step or to improve the relationship with hackers, I can intervene on any part of a program.
