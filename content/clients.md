## Courses

Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of training teams from startups to large enterprises across various sectors - including tech, finance, e-commerce, and public institutions. My courses have helped developers, sysadmins, and security teams level up their skills in web security, scripting, and secure development practices.

## Bug Bounty

Since 2016, I’ve been hunting bugs across some of the world’s biggest platforms - uncovering vulnerabilities, writing tools, and helping companies strengthen their security.
