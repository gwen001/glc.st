​The Pentest training is an intensive 3-day program designed to introduce __developers__, __system administrators__ and any __cybersecurity enthusiasts__ to the fundamentals of __ethical hacking__.
Through a combination of __theory__ and __practical exercises__ in dedicated environments, participants will learn how to __identify and exploit vulnerabilities__ in web applications and network services.
Essential tools such as __Kali Linux__, __Metasploit__, __Burp Suite__ and more will be covered.
At the end of the training, participants will be able to conduct effective security audits and strengthen the protection of their IT infrastructures.
