## Courses

Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of training teams from startups to large enterprises across various sectors - including tech, finance, e-commerce, and public institutions. My courses have helped developers, sysadmins, and security teams level up their skills in web security, scripting, and secure development practices.

## Bug Bounty

Since 2016, I’ve been hunting bugs across some of the world’s biggest platforms - uncovering vulnerabilities, writing tools, and helping companies strengthen their security. From misconfigurations to critical exploits, I’ve reported hundreds of issues, learned from the best, and shared my knowledge with the community.
Here are some companies I have been working with and some findings.
