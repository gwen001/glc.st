An issue was discovered in the Huge-IT gallery-images plugin before 1.9.0 for WordPress. The headers `Client-Ip` and `X-Forwarded-For` are prone to unauthenticated SQL injection. The affected file is `gallery-images.php`. The affected function is `huge_it_image_gallery_ajax_callback()`.

<hr />

While I was working on a famous bug bounty program, WPScan returns me the list of the plugins configured on the Wordpress install.
Here is what I found in one of them: [Image Gallery by Huge-IT](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gallery-images/).

WPScan output, no issues known:

```none
[+] Name: gallery-images - v1.8.6  
 |  Location: https://[REDACTED]/wp-content/plugins/gallery-images/  
 |  Readme: https://[REDACTED]/wp-content/plugins/gallery-images/readme.txt  
```

After a fast search on [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/) with no success, I finally decided to download it and read the code to find vulnerabilites by myself.
Since the readme was available, I was able to confirm the version of the plugin.

I was looking for two kind of vulnerabilities: file upload and sql injection.
First thing I did was to locate PHP files, and grepping the result to find `Content-Disposition` header:

```bash
$ find . -name "*.php*" | xargs grep -i header
./Front_end/gallery_front_end_view.php:							header("Location:".$actual_link."");
./Front_end/gallery_front_end_view.php:							header("Location:".$actual_link."");
./Front_end/gallery_front_end_view.php:							header("Location:".$actual_link."");
./Front_end/gallery_front_end_view.php:							header("Location:".$actual_link."");
./Front_end/gallery_front_end_view.php:		/*HEIGHT FROM HEADER.PHP*/
./Front_end/gallery_front_end_view.php:							header("Location:".$actual_link."");
./Front_end/gallery_front_end_view.php:							header("Location:".$actual_link."");
./Front_end/gallery_front_end_view.php:							header("Location:".$actual_link."");
./Front_end/gallery_front_end_view.php:							header("Location:".$actual_link."");
./Front_end/gallery_front_end_view.php:							header("Location:".$actual_link."");
./Front_end/gallery_front_end_view.php:							header("Location:".$actual_link."");
./admin/gallery_func.php:			header('Location: admin.php?page=gallerys_huge_it_gallery&id='.$rowsldccs->id.'&task=apply');
./admin/gallery_view.php:	header('Location: admin.php?page=gallerys_huge_it_gallery&id='.$row->id.'&task=apply');
./admin/gallery_view.php:	<div id="gallery-header">
```

Nothing interesting here...

Then, I noticed that the "non admin" requests where mainly coded in two files: `gallery-images.php` and `Front_end/gallery_front_end_view.php`.
Luckily I started to read the first one which contains the hole.

In the function `huge_it_image_gallery_ajax_callback`, the variable `$huge_it_ip` is used multiple times in the following form:

```php
$wpdb->prepare("SELECT `image_status`,`ip` FROM ".$wpdb->prefix."huge_itgallery_like_dislike WHERE image_id = %d AND `ip` = '".$huge_it_ip."'",(int)$row->id);
```

This variable is defined at the top of the file:

```php
if(!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'])){
	$huge_it_ip=$_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'];
}
elseif(!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])){
	$huge_it_ip=$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
}
else{
	$huge_it_ip=$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
}
```

Unfortunately HTTP headers cannot be trusted, even ip address.
So I started to test the injection in `X-Forwarded-For` header and it worked perfectly on my local install.
However the site I was testing seems to had a firewall who drop this header. 
I then tested the injection in `Client-Ip` header and it passed !

Note that the plugin must be enabled to be able to exploit the injection.
Finally here is the full request in Burp Suite:

```

The parameter `task` can be one of the following:  
load_images_content  
load_images_lightbox  
load_image_justified  
load_image_thumbnail  
load_blog_view

And the result:

A Full Path Disclosure is also available if you call `http://www.example.com/wp-content/plugins/gallery-images/gallery-images.php`

I sent an email to Huge-IT who released a fix the same day. Fast enough :)
