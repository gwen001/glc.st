> There is a vulnerability in the below program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed, can you find it? 
Files for this level can be found in /home/flag01.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys types.h="">
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;

  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();

  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);

  system("/usr/bin/env echo and now what?");
}
```

This program has been compiled and the executable is available in `/home/flag01`.

Note that it has the famous suid bit again:

The goal here is to inject or execute "something" (ie. a shell) by overriding the system command `echo`. 
Luckily the program uses `/usr/bin/env` which means that it will be sensitive to the environment of the current user including the `PATH` variable.

So the first point is to provide our own `echo` command:

Then add the current directory in the `PATH` list:

And finally, run the program:
