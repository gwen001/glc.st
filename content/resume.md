Independent cybersecurity expert

# About

After more than 15 years of web development, I finally decided to follow my dream: perform in the security industry.
In 2015, after 3 months of hard work, I successfully passed the famous exam Penetration Testing with Kali Linux exam aka OSCP.

Then, security became my daily.  
With more than 8 years of experience in <mark>bug bounty</mark>, I had the opportunity to study several aspects of this industry.
I also performed many <mark>security audits</mark> with companies the last 5 years.

I am an active member of the community as I <mark>developped many tools</mark> to automate the basics of recon.  
I created and maintain <mark>offsec.tools</mark>, a vast collection of security tools for bug bounty, pentest and red teaming.
I now sell my services as an independent cybersecurity expert:
- <mark>pentest web</mark>
- <mark>system audit</mark>
- <mark>code review</mark>
- <mark>trainer</mark>
