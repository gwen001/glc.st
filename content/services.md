Code reviews, pentest, system audit are my daily

After the audit you get a report resuming the checks performed, the issues found and some recommendations.
Because of my developer background, I am able to understand how to fix them and potentially help in this task.

## Bug bounty

With more than 8 years of experience, I had the opportunity to study several aspects of this industry:

- As a bug hunter, I am pretty familiar with the expectations of hackers:
What they look for, what are their problems, what make them more involved...

- As a consultant, I help companies to manage their program.
How to choose a scope, how to create a reward policy, what are SLAs, how to handle the reports, how to deal with hackers...

- As this list shows, I spent time to study [the main platforms](https://github.com/disclose/bug-bounty-platforms) available on the current market.
Depending of some criterias (size, country, law...) some of them may fit better to your business.

In a nutshell my goal is to help all actors in the bug bounty industry to be successful and develop the programs on the long term.
