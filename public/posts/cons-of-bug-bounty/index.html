            <p>This article is the following of the previous one (obviously&hellip;) about <a href="https://glc.st/posts/why-bug-bounty/">why I love bug bounty</a>.
However I realized that that one sounds like everything is perfect in this job, but since the world is not whole pinky full of rainbows, and butterflies, and unicorns, I have to say the truth.
Long time resolution, loneliness, deception, companies, there are also bad points (or maybe I&rsquo;m just frustrated to get so much duplicates these days xD).</p>
<h2 id="private-invite">Private invite</h2>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s fictional? Mystical? Maybe Spiritual.</p>
<p>We all know that private invitations are very interesting for hackers, less competition, but it can be a terrible painful loooooonnnnnnnggggg way to get some.
Reputation, impact, signal, my statistics are the magic that decide if I receive private invitations or not.
Before that, I had to work on public programs, those programs have been tested again and again by many great hackers.
Of course it&rsquo;s much more complicated when you are a beginner in bug bounty or in the all security industry.
Like everyone, you firstly try the basic stuff, that way you will have a hard time to find valid bugs in order to improve your stats.<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/bb-cons-mystats.png" alt="My Hakerone statistics"></p>
<h2 id="duplicates">Duplicates</h2>
<p>You have it or you don&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s a fallacy.</p>
<p>Because yes, I&rsquo;m not alone in this world, I&rsquo;m not the only hacker, I have opponents.
They also have skills, knowledge and imagination.
If I can find a bug they can do it too.
The competition is tough and I have to be the first one to report the bug if I want the money/reputation/swag/tee-shirt/pogs.
Hackers play from all around the world.
When I&rsquo;m sleeping at 4am, there is someone on the other side of this planet that is already reconning the new public programs.
And when I&rsquo;ll wake up tomorrow morning, he will probably already have reported some subdomain takeover or vulnerable buckets.</p>
<p>Plus, some companies are late to fix the bugs, it&rsquo;s still possible to get duplicates of reports that are 6 month old&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://glc.st/images/bb-cons-myreports-status.png" alt="low SLA metrics"></p>
<h2 id="bounty-deception">Bounty deception</h2>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t happy, I&rsquo;m feeling glad.</p>
<p>I find a RCE, the company promises 5000$ for that kind of issue but I only get 500$.
What the Hell Â§@#&amp;$Â£!!!!
The server is outdated since ages, there is nothing interesting/sensitive on it, it&rsquo;s outside the current architecture and maintained by an external group blablabla&hellip;
I&rsquo;m fucked. Yes it happens, sometimes.</p>
<p>I find 5 XSS, I open 5 reports but 4 of them are closed as duplicate of the first one.
How could this happen??
if a single patch fix them all, that means they share the same root cause and same root cause implies a single bounty.
That&rsquo;s the rule in bug bounty.
Unfair? Your opinion.</p>
<p>The bug highly impact the main in-scope target but through an out-of-scope asset. Once again, it&rsquo;s up to the company to decide if it rewards the report or not.
Time for a nice &ldquo;Bounty plz&rdquo;. Check this fantastic example of unfair decision by Twitter: <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/273698">https://hackerone.com/reports/273698</a></p>
<h2 id="companies">Companies</h2>
<p>Pick and choose, Sit and lose.</p>
<p>There are many various reasons for why a company opens a bug bounty program.
The problem is that sometimes it underestimates the hard work and the responsabilities that this involves.
It desn&rsquo;t have enough people in their security team to absorb the flow of reports and most of the time those peoples already have a daily job, they are not dedicated to bug bounty.</p>
<p>What are the consequences?
<a href="https://www.hackerone.com/blog/Healthy-programs-make-happy-hackers-Introducing-response-SLAs">SLA metrics</a> tumble down, the program becomes less and less reponsive, bugs are not solved, more and more duplicates, big delays in payments, frustration, angry hackers.</p>
<p><img src="https://glc.st/images/bb-cons-sla.png" alt="low SLA metrics"></p>
<h2 id="burn-your-mind">Burn your mind</h2>
<p>No squealing, remember that it&rsquo;s all in your head.</p>
<p>So so much things to do. I want to do everything, I want to play with all programs, I want to recon all domains, I want to test all tools, I want to learn Python/Ruby/Go, I want to pratice CTF, my todo list is growing faster than Sharknado chapters.
But you know what? Sadly, there is only 24 hours a day :/</p>
<p>Even if I exchange alot with my similars, even if I&rsquo;m active on Twitter and Slack, I mainly hunt alone.
Even if I train on dedicated platforms, even if I pratice CTF, I mainly learn alone.
That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Sometimes I don&rsquo;t earn a single dollar for weeks while I see other people tweeting about the big rewards they got because of internal website with login/pass:admin/admin, then I question my whole life: WHY NOT ME Â§Â§Â§Â§ Why I don&rsquo;t find bugs like this, why I choosed this job, why it&rsquo;s raining today, why GoT is not on Netflix and why the hell my washing machine keeps eating my socks!!!!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now you shouldn&rsquo;t be scared.</p>
<p>As I previously said in the previous article I previously wrote, the best way to make your own opinion is to give it a try, also take care to read the stories linked at the very bottom of this page.</p>
