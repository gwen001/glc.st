<p>Below the different steps that led me to The Holy Flag.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-first-things-first-find-an-attack-surface">Step 1, first things first: find an attack surface</h2>
<p>As usual when I approach a new target, I immediately fired up my Burp Suite and started a directory scan with several tools like Cansina, Dirb and Dirsearch, each time with a different wordlist: SVNDigger, Robots Disallowed and Raft ones. Below the urls discovered:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>http://104.236.20.43/index.html
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>http://104.236.20.43/icons/README
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>http://104.236.20.43/flag
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>At the end of the scan I tried to compare the discovered items with my local Apache using <code>diff</code> to check if any modification occured but they were all identical.
While <code>/index.html</code> is the default Apache index page, <code>/icons/README</code> the default Apache icons list and of course it would be too easy if this <code>/flag</code> file would be the good one&hellip;<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-fake-flag.png" alt="ctf h1-212 fake flag"></p>
<p>At the same time I ran a Nmap scan on all TCP ports and top 500 UDP. This result to only two open ports: 22 and 80.
I quickly tried a brute force against SSH with Patator but it failed.</p>
<p>I then decided to use Burp Suite to try another type of issue called <code>Virtual Host Enumeration</code>.
I jumped on this because I recently read an article about that and I also sent a similar report to a private program a week before. Since the brilliant engineer works for <code>acme.org</code>, I configured the attack for this domain.
And it found something interesting at <code>admin.acme.org</code>:

<h2 id="step-2-bargain-with-the-server">Step 2, bargain with the server</h2>
<p>I was supposed to have access to an hidden admin now so what&rsquo;s next ? Let&rsquo;s check the response of the server:
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-host-found.png" alt="ctf h1-212 host found"></p>
<p>Looks like we have a cookie to play with! Obviously the first thing you would try is to change the value from <code>admin=no</code> to <code>admin=yes</code>&hellip;
Here we go, and the new response is:<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-admin-yes.png" alt="ctf h1-212 admin yes"></p>
<p>The message is clear enough, the <code>GET</code> method is not allowed, so switching to <code>POST</code> would return:<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-method-post.png" alt="ctf h1-212 method post"></p>
<p>According to the official documentation, aka Wikipedia xD<br>
<em>&quot;<strong>406 Not Acceptable</strong>:
The requested resource is capable of generating only content not acceptable according to the Accept headers sent in the request.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Ok then&hellip; Altering the header <code>Accept</code> will not change anything, however if I also change the <code>Content-Type</code> in the request&hellip;<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-content-type-json.png" alt="ctf h1-212 content type json"></p>
<p>Server says that I am supposed to provide a body now, let&rsquo;s say parameters, in JSON format. Since I have no idea about the name of the parameters, I supplied an empty string:<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-body-param.png" alt="ctf h1-212 body param"></p>
<p>The server requires a <code>domain</code> so let&rsquo;s feed him with that! I won&rsquo;t show you all the errors returned by the server (<code>.com</code> required, <code>212</code> required etc&hellip;) but here is the final string I got:<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-good-domain.png" alt="ctf h1-212 good domain"></p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">List of HTTP status codes</a></p>
<h2 id="step-3-start-crying-12">Step 3, start crying 1/2</h2>
<p>At this point here is the request I had:<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-read-php.png" alt="ctf h1-212 read php"></p>
<p>I firstly tried SQLi by injecting single quote, double quotes, encoded values, using SQLmap blablabla, nothing.<br>
I then tried XSS by injecting single quote, double quotes, less-than symbol, encoded values again and still nothing.<br>
I tried Local File Inclusion with Jhaddix worlists, nothing.<br>
I also tried to inject extra parameters and extra headers as well, nothing.<br>
I had a hard time to find the next step, I stayed stuck here 1 full day, trying figure out what kind of attack would work.</p>
<p>After a night break, I read a comment from another hacker that had scripted the 2 requests to be able to run them automatically in a row.
At this moment I understood that there was probably a link between the POST request and the result of <code>read.php</code>.
To be honest I would not had realize that by myself.
I simply thought that the previous step was done and jumped to the next one without even thinking there could be a relation&hellip; errrrrr that was my first mistake.</p>
<p>So I did it too. I PHP curly scripted the requests, and from here I only used my script to find the flag, that was my second mistake, this is probably the reason why I didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>So basically, altering the <code>domain</code> provided in the JSON param in the body of the POST request would lead to a different response when calling <code>read.php</code> with the corresponding <code>id</code> returned by the server.
After playing a little bit with the value, injecting stupid characters and so on, I finally was able to retrieve datas and I quickly realized that I was in front of a SSRF issue.<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-ssrf-80.png" alt="ctf h1-212 ssrf 80"></p>
<p>The final response is the base64 encoded result of the HTTP request performed by the server. In this case: <code>http://localhost:80/index.html</code> the default Apache page.</p>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> at each HTTP POST request performed by the server, <code>id</code> is incremented by 1.
Sometimes it get back to 0 but I didn&rsquo;t figure out why/when/how. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be shared between the hackers.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-or-4-or-5-port-scanning">Step 3 or 4 or 5, port scanning</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that this step was supposed to be the last one but when I&rsquo;m able to trigger a SSRF issue, I always perform a port scan first.</p>
<p>I simply moved my 2 curl requests into a <code>for</code> loop that iterates from 1 to 65535, because why not ?
Ok, Jobert said that brute force is not the key but you know&hellip; I&rsquo;m still a kid in my mind, I&rsquo;m a geek, I&rsquo;m a hacker so&hellip;
when someone tell me to NOT do something, then I feel really bad if I don&rsquo;t give it a single try!</p>
<p>After few minutes and some false positive, my script displayed a different response corresponding to the port <code>1337</code>:<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-ssrf-1337.png" alt="ctf h1-212 ssrf 1337"></p>
<p>Confirmed with Burp:
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-ssrf-1337-burp.png" alt="ctf h1-212 ssrf 1337 burp"></p>
<p>Easy peasy.<br>
I was pretty sure this was the key so I stopped my script at port 19187, enough spam.</p>

<h2 id="step-x-try-harder-cry-stronger-22">Step x, try harder, cry stronger 2/2</h2>
<p>Ok I have the good parameter, a good domain, good Content-Type, good cookie, the l33t port, I can decode base64, so far so good!
Now I simply need to request a single file like <code>/index.html</code> or <code>/flag</code>, that would be great!
Hopefully this is the final step. Unfortunately this is where things gone wrong :/</p>
<p>I read many documentation and articles about SSRF but the most useful was the SSRF bible and the presentation from Orange Tsai. Simply awesome.
The idea: <code>http://1.1.1.1 &amp;@2.2.2.2# @3.3.3.3/</code><br>
Since <code>&amp;</code>, <code>%</code> and <code>#</code> are forbidden characters in this challenge, from this two papers I understood that I should combine the SSRF with a CRLF.
Dealing with <code>\r</code> and <code>\n</code> I quickly got a strange behavior:<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-ssrf-1337-400.png" alt="ctf h1-212 ssrf 1337 400"></p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes, it&rsquo;s not Apache anymore, I am now dealing with a Nginx install.
Does it matter ? Well I don&rsquo;t know, maybe those servers don&rsquo;t react to CRLF the same way&hellip;</p>
<p>Since the first part of the domain must contain <code>212</code> and the last part must end by <code>.com</code>, I had configure a dns <code>A</code> record of my own domain to point to <code>127.0.0.1</code>, that was useless but hey, how could I know!
Based on the &ldquo;3 parts payload&rdquo; mentionned by Orange Tsai, here are some stuff I tried:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>poc212.10degres.net:1337/flag @www.google.com @h1-212.acme.com

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>poc212.10degres.net:1337 @www.google.com @/h1-212.acme.com
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After some hours (&hellip;) I decided to use the SSRF against my own server, that way I could see what kind of requests the CTF server send.
Installing and configuring Nginx. Configuring a <code>.com</code> domain I have and the vhost that will be accepted by Jobert&rsquo;s code as well.
Same same but different:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>poc212.10degres.net:1337/flag @www.google.com @h1-212.10degres.com

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Checking the log, again and again and still got this f*****g error 400:
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-nginx-400.png" alt="ctf h1-212 nginx 400"></p>
<p>Better use Netcat to see the headers received:<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-netcat-400.png" alt="ctf h1-212 netcat 400"></p>
<p>Well not so much information here&hellip; Let&rsquo;s try with tcdump then:
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-tcpdump.png" alt="ctf h1-212 tcpdump"></p>
<p>Still nothing&hellip; Let&rsquo;s try something a bit more tricky. What about CRLF combined with header injection ?
My new payload looked like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>poc212.10degres.net:1337/flag HTTP/1.0\rHost: admin.acme.org\rCookie: admin=yes\r @h1-212.10degres.com
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-header-injection.png" alt="ctf h1-212 header injection"></p>
<p>Hey but what about encoding ? Yeah yeah yeah I tried that too, since <code>%</code> is not allowed, I had to try something else:
<code>\x0A</code> <code>0x0A</code> <code>\u000A</code> and the whole family, of course it didn&rsquo;t work&hellip;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the great <a href="https://twitter.com/EdOverflow">@EdOverflow</a> gave me a hint, <em>kudos</em> to him.
He told me that I have gone too far with header injection, the solution was much simpler, I should focus on the first part of the payload.
That said, after a full day on this shit (and some violent outrage against Jobert ^^), I gave up for a good night.</p>
<p>Next day, let&rsquo;s recap what I learned the day before:
the first part and the third part of the three part payload (found in Orange Tsai doc) are injectable and trigger the SSRF to a domain I can control and depending of the characters I use for the CRLF (<code>\t</code> <code>\s</code> <code>\r</code> <code>\s</code> <code>\b</code> <code>💩</code>)  the server acts different, which seems to be logic&hellip;</p>
<p>Ok! New payloads on the way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>0:1337/flag\r\nh1-212.10degres.com
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>No more luck, I continued to alter it with different characters, different encoding.
I also tried different protocols found in the SSRF bible: http, https, file, gopher, dict, mailto and so on&hellip;
With a good wordlist and a <code>for</code> loop it was easy to test them all but unfortunately no matter what I tried, my script always returned empty data.</p>
<p>One more day wasted for nothing, I didn&rsquo;t move forward :/
I won&rsquo;t show you all the payloads I tried, thousands and thousands, the only thing you need to know is that they all failed!
But the real question is: did they really failed?</p>

<h2 id="the-answer-free-your-mind">The answer, free your mind&hellip;</h2>
<p>After 5 full days working on the challenge, I finally spent the 2 last days with my childrens, trying to get over the headhash.
Since the challenge was ended, I decided to ask the answer to <a href="https://twitter.com/EdOverflow">@EdOverflow</a>, knowing that I would probably cry&hellip; and guess what? I did!</p>
<p>Remember that the <code>id</code> returned by the POST request is incremented by 1 for each request made by the server ?
But what if I inject a CRLF and the server does 2 requests ? Then the id returned will be incremented by 2, because 1+1=2!
Holy cow!!!!</p>
<p>Running my script like a moron, I only focused my mind on the result of <code>/read.php</code> and I didn&rsquo;t even notice that the id jump the steps 2 by 2&hellip;<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-moron.png" alt="ctf h1-212 moron"></p>
<p>So I need to decrease the id by 1 to get the result of the previous request.
Which is supposed to be the content of the file I requested aka <code>http://0:1337/flag</code>.
<img src="https://glc.st/images/ctf-h1-212-answer.png" alt="ctf h1-212 answer"></p>
<p>Et voilà ! Decoded value:<br>
FLAG: CF,2dsV\/]fRAYQ.TDEp`w&quot;M(%mU;p9+&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
