            <p>One month ago I started to chase on a new private program.
Since we were in touch by mail and since their office is pretty close to my place, I proposed to meet.
They immediatly accepted.
We talked for an hour, about security, my job, their program.
That was so interesting, question after question, we learned alot from each other.
I though it would be nice to share this experience, some people probably have some of these questions in mind, so in this article I tried to resume our interview.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-company">About the company</h2>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s a private program, I cannot reveal too much details about the company, I will call it: Monka.<br>
Monka is a french company, based in Paris. Created in 2016, they are now more than 100 employees.
Monka has developed a SaaS about accounting stuff.
Datas privacy is really important in this domain so in June 2018 they decided to open a bug bounty program on <a href="https://hackerone.com/">Hackerone</a> in order to improve their security.
Needless to say that they have been very surprised by how things went.</p>
<h2 id="me-questions">Me questions</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How did you heard about bug bounty and Hackerone?</strong></p>
<p>This is something that have been recommended to us by a friend.
He works in a company that also have a program on Hackerone and he seems to be very happy about it.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: What is your internal organization regarding security and how do you manage your bug bounty program?</strong></p>
<p>For now we don&rsquo;t have a person dedicated to security.
We have selected 3 people from our tech team to manage our Hackerone account.
Every day a new person take a look at the tickets and assign the new ones to the concerned team.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: Do you receive many reports?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! We are overloaded, we didn&rsquo;t expect that.
It takes much more time than we expected and requires several qualities: development, security, community management&hellip;<br>
A security engineer will join us full time in 5 days and he will manage our H1 account.
Hopefully this will help to flush the queue of reports and triage faster in the near future.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: What kind of issue do you receive?</strong></p>
<p>We mainly have IDORs, some of them are really critical.
But honestly we also receive alot of low reports, what we call &ldquo;noise&rdquo;.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: Do you use an internal bug tracker?</strong></p>
<p>Depending of the team we use Trello, Github issues and ZenHub extension.
But the single source of truth still Hackerone issues tracker.
We know that it&rsquo;s possible to integrate Jira with Hackerone, we are thinking about it.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: What about the money, do you have a limit?</strong></p>
<p>No, we don&rsquo;t have a fixed budget, we want to continue as far as we receive valid reports and see how it will go.
It&rsquo;s good for us, we are very happy that hackers find issues.
It&rsquo;s easy to understand that it&rsquo;s much better for everyone that an honest security researcher find the holes in our system instead of a black hacker with bad intentions.
It&rsquo;s worse the money.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: How many private invitation did you send?</strong></p>
<p>We send 2 invitations by day.
We launched the program 3 months ago, so about 200 invitations now.
But at the end only few hackers work on our program (~10 thanks).
Many hackers refuse the invitation because of the language of our application (it&rsquo;s not english) or because of the specific domain we are evolving.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: Have you been in trouble with any hackers?</strong></p>
<p>Not so much, but managing the program require a good communication skill.
We had some problems because of the delay to reward, or because we didn&rsquo;t agree with the criticity of the bug.
We also &ldquo;lost&rdquo; some tickets when we stopped the report managment by the platform itself, it didn&rsquo;t fit to us.
Sometimes we spend more time on invalid reports than valid ones, trying to make everyone happy.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: Do you communicate with your customers about your bug bounty program?</strong></p>
<p>Not yet but this is something we have in mind for marketing purpose.
We will probably create a security page on our corporate website.
But we are afraid that hackers bypass H1 and use direct contact.
We couldn&rsquo;t accept bugs or reward them if the official program is paused.</p>
<h2 id="the-company-questions">The company questions</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How long do you work in the security industry?</strong></p>
<p>I started security in 2015, I passed OSCP in September/October.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: Do you perform bug bounty full time? When did you start?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I started bug bounty in Sebruary 2016 half time, and I perform full time since June 2017.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: Does it pay well?</strong></p>
<p>Depends, some months I find a lot of bugs, the company is very effective, fast to triage/fix/reward, and so nice bounties, and sometimes it sucks xD
Slow triage, low bounties, many duplicates&hellip;<br>
It&rsquo;s definitely not something linear.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: How many programs do you work on at the same time?</strong></p>
<p>I try to keep 4/5 programs in my pool (reality is more 3), plus the quick recon I always perform when I receive a new invitation.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: Do you receive many private invitations? How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>As far as I know, to receive private invites you need to be active (submit valid reports) and a minimum reputation.
That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important for hackers, otherwise they have to work on public programs and it&rsquo;s more difficult to find bugs.<br>
I usually receive 3/4 invites a week but then I have to filter according my own criterias.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: Which are?</strong></p>
<p>Technologies:
Since I&rsquo;m a web developper, I mostly target webapps.
I also use mobile apps to find new informations like endpoints or S3 buckets, but I don&rsquo;t test the app itself.
No way for me to play with Python or C librairies :)</p>
<p>Hacktivity:
Quickly check if the program is dead  or alive. Who are my challengers and how many reputation points they got on this program.</p>
<p>Rewards:
Because I do it for living.</p>
<p>And the most important SLA/response time:
I prefer to earn 1k$ in a week than 5k$ in a year #monthlybills
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: Do you play on managed program?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, as a hacker I try to avoid that&hellip;
This is something that researchers don&rsquo;t really enjoy.<br>
We never know if the triager will send the report to the company or not.
The point is that only the company is able to say if the bug is &ldquo;by design&rdquo;, if they really own this bucket or not, if a P4 is more a P2&hellip;
Unfortunately there are some examples on Twitter where people complain about that :/<br>
For me it&rsquo;s also a nice part of the job, I mean in my previous developer life, I would never imagine that I would be able to talk with the tech team of such big companies like Yahoo, Uber, Deliveroo&hellip;
It&rsquo;s so interesting, I really love that.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: Do you think we should change the scope to *.domain.com?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to you. Are you ready to handle more reports?
Will you be able to fix all bugs found?<br>
Your <code>www</code> is managed by a third company service, will they fix the bugs?
If not you will just make angry hackers and kill your reputation.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: Do you think we should award swag?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely!
Researchers love swag, a little bonus because of the quality of the report, hoodies, stickers, whatever!<br>
You should take a look at the famous Dutch gouvernment :)
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: Are you in touch with other hackers?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, I already talked with some hackers that also work on your program :)</p>
<h2 id="more">More</h2>
<p>I have been to several meetings organized by bug bounty platforms where they try to convince guests to create a program (understand convert them as customers), and there is one question that always come back over and over.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: What would prevent a hacker to use the issues for bad pruposes or publish/sell the datas on Internet?</strong><br>
Short answer: nothing.</p>
<p>But what would prevent a hacker to do it right now, without bug bounty?
Maybe it&rsquo;s already done but you just don&rsquo;t know about it?
There is no more reason to attack your platform, and by attack I mean &ldquo;perform bad things&rdquo;, with or without bug bounty.
In fact, it&rsquo;s exactly the opposite, hackers are more prone to help you if you have a security program.
They get money, they get reputation, they get recognition from the community, they can talk about their findings, they can find a job&hellip;
So many pros to be a white hat instead of black.</p>
<p>But like every relationships, it works both way, as long as you act fairly the researchers have no reason to hate you, so keep cool and eat penguins :)</p>
