            <p>This is a real story or not, that occured in mid 2017 or not, about a private program or not, on Hackerone or not, believe me or not, but it changed my life.
I would like to thanks all the people from this company I talked with.
They were very nice with me, very fast to fix the bugs and I always got the rewards in less than 7 days, frequently the day of the report, even for the smallest bugs.
Thanks to them, I wish we could find more program like this one.</p>
<p>The money was not the only good thing I earned during this period, my reputation on Hackerone also grew up very fast.
From here I received many private invitations, sometimes 3 or 4, up to 5 a week, and we all know that private programs are very important for hunters.
I also learned alot because it was the very first time that I was able to play with such issues, I mean in real life, not on a training platform, so it was really really formative.</p>
<p>Some people were mad on me because I didn&rsquo;t want to share my findings in this program.
Come on guys&hellip;
Following each others on Twitter doesn&rsquo;t mean I want/can disclose the details of the issues I found in a private program, specially if you&rsquo;re also working on&hellip;<br>
It would be like cutting the branch of the tree I&rsquo;m sitting on.
I hope you understand that.<br>
Kisses :)</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Had a hard a time to contact the company, the kool <a href="https://twitter.com/emgeekboy">@Geekboy</a> helped me to enter in the game, thanks to him.</p>
<p>So I joined with 1 subdomain takeover on Cloudfront and 2 SQL injection on a minor subdomain, not bad at all, promising.</p>
<h2 id="first-hit-well-official-hit">First hit, well, &ldquo;official&rdquo; hit&hellip;</h2>
<p>A big scan with Dirb on another subdomain revealed a <code>.git</code> directory.
Using the program <a href="https://github.com/koto/gitpillage">gitpillage</a>, I got some interesting files:<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/pp-git-listing.png" alt="Private program git listing"></p>
<p>That could be enough to write a report but since it was PHP code and since I can read PHP, I jumped in the source (PHP guru will recognize the very old Zend Studio 5.5 here xD).
<img src="https://glc.st/images/pp-git-code.png" alt="Private program git code"></p>
<p>I quickly found some calls to <code>exec()</code>, that allow a developper to execute system commands.
By tracking the creation of the command string, I had notice that a POST parameter was used without any sanitization.
Simplified, the code looked like this:</p>

<p>W00t w00t bounty time :)</p>
<h2 id="replay">Replay</h2>
<p>Some weeks later, and some others issues later (CORS/CSRF/source code disclosure/rate limit), another SQL injection popped on the main domain.<br>
<img src="https://glc.st/images/pp-sqli.png" alt="Private program sqli"></p>
<p>Since I said to the company to take care about the vulnerable module where I found the RCE, 1 month later I came back in the same place and tried to reproduce the bug.
Was fixed, the vulnerable parameter wasn&rsquo;t anymore.
But what about all others and what about the other scripts in the repository?</p>
<p>KA-CHING! Got 3 more RCE.</p>
<p>One of them required 3 parameters in his input:</p>
<ul>
<li>path</li>
<li>filename</li>
<li>contents</li>
</ul>
<p>This script wrote the content <code>contents</code> in the file <code>filename</code> created in the directory <code>path</code>.
The perfect backdoor. Congrats captain Obvious!</p>
<p><img src="https://glc.st/images/pp-rce-2.png" alt="Private program rce"></p>
<h2 id="bouncing-from-a-rce-to-another-rce">Bouncing from a RCE to another RCE</h2>
<p>Is that fair or not? Well I don&rsquo;t know but while I was &ldquo;connected&rdquo; to the server of the company, and since I knew that they have a functionality to handle images,
I checked the version of the library ImageMagick.
<img src="https://glc.st/images/pp-imagetragick-1.png" alt="Private program imagetragick"></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re hunter you probably already heard about the famous <a href="https://imagetragick.com/">ImageTragick</a>,
version prior to 6.9.3-9 are prone to multiple vulnerabilities including RCE.
Here is the PoC:
<img src="https://glc.st/images/pp-imagetragick-2.png" alt="Private program imagetragick"></p>
<p>The company was nice enough to reward those two RCE the same day.</p>
<h2 id="my-favorite">My favorite</h2>
<p>After I had seen the LevelUP 2017 video from the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/zseano">@zseano</a>,
kudos to him, where he explains how to find bugs by extracting datas from Javascript files, I decided to write my own program to extract endpoints and other juicy infos from source code.
Once done, I downloaded all JS files I found from my target, and ran my script.
Needless to say that hundreds of new endpoints popped.
One of them catched my eyes:
<code>/[REDACTED].php?[REDACTED]=[REDACTED]&amp;template=[REDACTED].tpl</code></p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re a web developper, you know that the extension <code>.tpl</code> is commonly used for HTML code rendered by template engines.
Could it be a filename as a parameter???
I immediately tried the value <code>/etc/passwd</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://glc.st/images/pp-lfd-1.png" alt="Private program local file disclosure"></p>
<p>Ok, this is a valid bug.
At first, I though it was a Local File Inclusion so I tried to upgrade to RCE with some tools like fimap, dotdotpwn or Kadimus and then manually but nope&hellip;
Since I didn&rsquo;t know the path of the application on the server, I was not able to include any PHP file.</p>
<p>When I find a serious bug like this, I always send the report the same day.
First because I want to avoid a stupid duplicate, second because the company has to be aware of it and fix ASAP!</p>
<p>The day after, the bug was still here.
Hmmm, well well well&hellip;
Ding Dang!
My brain had a flash, why to not try to include the PHP endpoint itself?!
Something like:
<code>/the_vulnerable_script.php?[REDACTED]=[REDACTED]&amp;template=the_vulnerable_script.php</code>
Guess what? I got the whole source code and it was not interpreted, so actually this was a Local File Disclosure.</p>
<p><img src="https://glc.st/images/pp-lfd-2.png" alt="Private program local file disclosure"></p>
<p>Jumping from include to include, I got some config files with database credentials, API keys of 3rd party services and so on&hellip;
After digging for a while, I finally got the Graal aka the hard coded <code>autoload</code> file.
Basically it&rsquo;s an array with the classname as the keys and the filepath as the values, here is a basic example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">&lt;?</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">php</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">?&gt;</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In a nutshell (Yaworsk favorite 3 words), I could access to the whole source of the application.
Not a RCE but still a nice catch :)
Some minutes later I got a script running and grabbing the files:</p>
<p><img src="https://glc.st/images/pp-lfd-3.png" alt="Private program local file disclosure"></p>
<p><img src="https://glc.st/images/pp-lfd-4.png" alt="Private program local file disclosure"></p>
<p>Game over!</p>
<p>I stayed in touch with the company all along the exploitation of this bug.
I stopped my script after a few minutes, I though that would not be fair/polite and legal to download everything.</p>
<h2 id="the-last-but-not-the-least">The last but not the least</h2>
<p>Using my previous findings, I had some more endpoints in my hands.
